## Ingredients
+ 1 1/2 lb 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, halved
+ 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
+ 2 tsp garlic salt
+ 1/2 tsp paprika
+ 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
+ 2 large eggs
+ 1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs
+ Extra light olive oil, or canola oil, or any high-heat cooking oil
+ Coarse salt, to sprinkle on fried chicken
+ Lemon wedges, for serving




## Directions
1. Line a cutting board with plastic wrap. Place the chicken on the cutting board in a single layer and cover the cutlets with a second layer of plastic wrap. Use a meat mallet or a rolling pin or the bottom of a heavy saucepan to pound the chicken thin, about 1‚ÅÑ4 inch. Cut each cutlet in half.

1. Set up three medium bowls: In the first, combine the flour, garlic salt, paprika, and pepper. In the second, use a fork to beat the eggs. In the third, add the panko breadcrumbs.

1. Dredge both sides of each cutlet in the flour, then the egg, letting any excess drip back into the bowl before breading the chicken in the panko. It helps to use a fork or tongs for this process to keep your hands clean.

1. Repeat with the remaining cutlets. Let the breaded cutlets rest for 10 minutes if time permits and the breading will stick better when frying.

1. Heat a large non-stick or cast iron pan over medium heat and add just enough oil to coat the bottom (about 3 Tbsp). When the oil shimmers, add a few cutlets to the pan, not crowding them. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until crispy and golden. Reduce the heat if they are browning too quickly. Transfer the cutlets to a paper towel-lined plate and slice into one to test for doneness; the juices should run clear and the meat should no longer be pink. Immediately sprinkle the cutlets with salt.

1. Repeat with the remaining cutlets, adding more oil as needed. To serve, squeeze the lemon wedges over the top.
