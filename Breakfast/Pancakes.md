## Ingredients
+ 1.5c all-purpose flour
+ 3T sugar
+ 1T baking powder
+ 1/4t salt
+ 1/8t freshly ground nutmeg
+ 2 large eggs, at room temperature
+ 1.25c milk, at room temperature
+ 1/2t pure vanilla extract
+ 3T unsalted butter, plus more as needed



## Directions
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.

1. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.

1. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.

1. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed.

1. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.

1. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.
