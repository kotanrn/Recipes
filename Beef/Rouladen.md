# Rouladen

## Quick notes 
```
1.5 hours
Serves: 8

Top Round (also known as Beef Round Top Round Steak)

Bottom Round – slightly tougher than top round but still usable.

Flank Steak – works well but is more expensive and has a more pronounced grain.

Sirloin Tip – can work in a pinch if sliced thin.
