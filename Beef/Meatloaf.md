## Quick notes 
```
Oven pre-heat: 350°F

1.25 hours
Serves: 6
```

## Ingredients
```
2 pounds ground beef (80/20 blend for optimal juiciness)
1 cup fresh breadcrumbs (or 3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs as substitute)
1/2 cup whole milk (almond milk works for dairy-free option)
1 large egg, beaten
1 medium onion, finely diced (about 1/2 cup)
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
```


## Directions
```
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a 9×5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving overhang for easy removal. This temperature ensures even cooking without drying out the exterior before the interior reaches the safe temperature of 160°F.

In a small bowl, combine breadcrumbs with milk and let sit for 5 minutes until the mixture resembles wet sand. This panade technique is the key to keeping your meatloaf incredibly moist—a professional chef secret that transforms ordinary ground beef into restaurant-quality results.

Heat a tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium heat and sauté the diced onion for 3-4 minutes until translucent. Add minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant. Allow to cool slightly—this step intensifies flavors and prevents the raw bite that ruins many homemade meatloaves.

In a large mixing bowl, gently combine the cooled onion mixture, beaten egg, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and fresh parsley. The key word here is “gently”—overmixing develops gluten and creates a dense, tough texture.

Add the ground beef and soaked breadcrumb mixture to the bowl. Using clean hands or a large spoon, mix just until combined—about 15-20 gentle folds. The mixture should hold together when squeezed but still look slightly rough around the edges.

Shape the mixture into a loaf and place it in your prepared pan. Press gently to eliminate air pockets, but avoid compacting too firmly. The loaf should have rounded edges and a slightly domed top for even cooking.

Whisk together ketchup, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, and Dijon mustard until smooth. This tangy-sweet glaze caramelizes beautifully and adds a professional finish that elevates the entire dish.

Bake for 45 minutes, then remove and brush with half the glaze. Return to oven for an additional 15-30 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 160°F.

Apply the remaining glaze and bake for 5 more minutes to set. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing—this crucial step allows juices to redistribute throughout the meat.
