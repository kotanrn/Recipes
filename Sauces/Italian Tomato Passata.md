## Ingredients
+ 5 kg Ripened Roma tomatoes, 176oz
+ 1 Red or Green bell pepper, capsicum
+ Extra virgin olive oil, EVOO
+ 2 tbsp Rock salt
+ Fresh basil leaves



## Directions
1. First step is to wash the tomatoes for the passata well. Then, put them into an XL mixing bowl (or two!) filled with water.

1. Homemade tomato sauce must be made with the perfect batch of tomatoes. Homegrown, organic/market-bought Roma or San Marzano are the best varieties.

1. Cut the green part out from the top of each tomato along with any bruised or black parts before cutting them in half then add to a large pot.

1. Add water to one of your passata bottles until it is half full. Pour this into your pot with tomatoes.

1. Now, cut the bell pepper/capsicum in half, remove the stem and seeds and slice into strips.

1. Add these to the pot of tomatoes and mix using your hands.

1. Put the pot on your stove to boil at a medium heat for 20-25 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.

1. After this time, the tomatoes should have started to break down and created a thick consistency.

1. Place a large colander in your big mixing bowl and pour the sauce inside. Strain this and let the liquid pour out into the bowl then place the tomato into another pot and repeat until you remove all excess liquid.

1. This liquid contains the bitter/watery part of the tomato so just discard it.

1. Now, add the tomato/capsicum mixture to the food mill (using a spoon/not too much) and pass it through into a large bowl, this will separate the skin from the flesh and start to create your passata!

1. Once you have extracted the juices, leave the tomato peel to the side in a bowl/colander.

1. Repeat until you have passed all of your tomato/capsicum mixture through the mill.

1. Every now and again, scrape down the bottom of the mill and let the polpa fall into the bowl.

1. Now, pass the tomato skins and any flesh through the mill again – you’ll be surprised how much more juice will come out!

1. Add one tablespoon rock salt to the passata (it will melt as the tomatoes should still be hot) and mix it through so it dissolves.

1. Add a few fresh leaves of basil (whole) to the bottom of the bottles you are using.
