## Ingredients
+ 1 quart (4 cups) chicken stock (homemade or good quality)
+ 1/2 lb ground chicken
+ 2 egg whites
+ 1 small onion, finely chopped
+ 1 small carrot, finely chopped
+ 1 small celery stalk, finely chopped
+ 1 small tomato, chopped (optional)
+ 1 sprig thyme



## Directions
#### Chill the Stock:
1. Start with cold chicken stock. Fat should be skimmed off or removed.
1. Make the Clarification Mixture (Raft):
1. In a bowl, combine the ground chicken, egg whites, chopped vegetables, and thyme. Mix gently.

#### Combine & Simmer:
1. Add the raft mixture to the cold stock in a large pot.
1. Stir well to combine.
1. Heat slowly over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally.
1. As it warms, the egg whites coagulate, rising to form a crusty raft on top.

#### Stop Stirring & Simmer Gently:
1. Once the raft forms, stop stirring.
1. Let it simmer gently (not boil) for 45–60 minutes.

#### Strain the Consommé:
1. Carefully ladle or pour the liquid through a fine strainer lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter.
1. Season with salt if needed.

#### Serve Hot, optionally with a garnish like julienne vegetables, a sprig of herbs, or tiny pasta.
