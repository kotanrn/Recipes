## Ingredients
```
1 quart (4 cups) chicken stock (homemade or good quality)
1/2 lb ground chicken
2 egg whites
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 small carrot, finely chopped
1 small celery stalk, finely chopped
1 small tomato, chopped (optional)
1 sprig thyme
```


## Directions
```
Chill the Stock:
  Start with cold chicken stock. Fat should be skimmed off or removed.
  Make the Clarification Mixture (Raft):
  In a bowl, combine the ground chicken, egg whites, chopped vegetables, and thyme. Mix gently.

Combine & Simmer:
  Add the raft mixture to the cold stock in a large pot.
  Stir well to combine.
  Heat slowly over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally.
  As it warms, the egg whites coagulate, rising to form a crusty raft on top.

Stop Stirring & Simmer Gently:
  Once the raft forms, stop stirring.
  Let it simmer gently (not boil) for 45–60 minutes.

Strain the Consommé:
  Carefully ladle or pour the liquid through a fine strainer lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter.
  Season with salt if needed.

Serve Hot, optionally with a garnish like julienne vegetables, a sprig of herbs, or tiny pasta.
