# Beef Consommé

## Quick notes 
```
Oven pre-heat:

3-4 hours
Serves: 6
```

## Ingredients
+ 1 quart (4 cups) beef stock (homemade is ideal, well-skimmed)
+ 1/2 lb lean ground beef
+ 2 egg whites
+ 1 small onion, finely chopped
+ 1 small carrot, finely chopped
+ 1 small celery stalk, finely chopped
+ 1 small tomato or 1 tbsp tomato paste
+ 1 clove garlic, minced
+ 1 sprig thyme or parsley
+ Salt to taste



## Directions
#### Chill the Stock:
1. Start with cold beef stock, thoroughly skimmed of fat.

#### Prepare the Raft:
1. Mix ground beef, egg whites, vegetables, tomato, and herbs in a bowl.

#### Combine & Heat:
1. Place the mixture into a large pot with the cold stock.
1. Stir well and slowly bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.

#### Form the Raft:
1. As the mixture heats, it will form a solid raft at the top. Stop stirring once this happens.
1. Make a small hole in the center of the raft to allow steam to escape.

#### Simmer Gently:
1. Let it simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours without disturbing the raft.

#### Strain Carefully:
1. Ladle the clear consommé out through a fine strainer lined with cheesecloth.
1. Taste and adjust seasoning.

#### Serve, optionally garnished with small vegetables, herbs, or beef shreds.
