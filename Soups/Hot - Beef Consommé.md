# Beef Consommé

## Time 
```
Oven pre-heat:

3-4 hours
Serves: 6
```

## Ingredients
```
1 quart (4 cups) beef stock (homemade is ideal, well-skimmed)
1/2 lb lean ground beef
2 egg whites
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 small carrot, finely chopped
1 small celery stalk, finely chopped
1 small tomato or 1 tbsp tomato paste
1 clove garlic, minced
1 sprig thyme or parsley
Salt to taste
```


## Directions
```
Chill the Stock:
  Start with cold beef stock, thoroughly skimmed of fat.

Prepare the Raft:
  Mix ground beef, egg whites, vegetables, tomato, and herbs in a bowl.

Combine & Heat:
  Place the mixture into a large pot with the cold stock.
  Stir well and slowly bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.

Form the Raft:
  As the mixture heats, it will form a solid raft at the top. Stop stirring once this happens.
  Make a small hole in the center of the raft to allow steam to escape.

Simmer Gently:
  Let it simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours without disturbing the raft.

Strain Carefully:
  Ladle the clear consommé out through a fine strainer lined with cheesecloth.

Taste and adjust seasoning.

Serve, optionally garnished with small vegetables, herbs, or beef shreds.
